## Introduction

Recursion is a powerful programming concept that involves a function calling itself to solve a problem. This repository aims to provide you with hands-on experience in writing recursive functions and understanding how recursion works in C.

## Exercises

Here's a list of the included recursion exercises:

1. `0-puts_recursion.c`: Print a string using recursion.
2. `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: Print a string in reverse using recursion.
3. `2-strlen_recursion.c`: Calculate the length of a string using recursion.
4. `3-factorial.c`: Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.
5. `4-pow_recursion.c`: Calculate the power of a number using recursion.
6. `5-sqrt_recursion.c`: Calculate the square root of a number using recursion.
7. `6-is_prime_number.c`: Check if a number is prime using recursion.
8. `100-is_palindrome.c`: Check if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
9. `101-wildcmp.c`: Compare two strings containing special characters using recursion.

## Usage

Each exercise is implemented as a separate C file. You can compile and run these files individually to see the results of each recursion function. For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 0-puts_recursion.c -o puts_recursion
./puts_recursion
```

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of recursion.
